He gained a local following before joining a partnership agreement with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Columbia Records, and attained mainstream popularity in 2021 with his collaboration with Justin Bieber on "Stay", which charted globally at number 1 in numerous countries including his native Australia, Canada, the United States, and others.
